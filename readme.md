# OpenCV Fundamentals - Week 1

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This repository contains the code, notes, and research for **OpenCV Fundamentals - Week 1**.  
The goal of this assignment is to build a solid foundation in OpenCV, covering its core modules, image processing techniques, and practical applications.  
Both theoretical and practical components are included, with examples in Python using `cv2` and supporting libraries.

## ðŸ“– Topics Covered
1. **Introduction to OpenCV** â€“ history, installation, and setup.
2. **Core Functionality (`core` module)** â€“ matrices, arrays, and utility functions.
3. **Image Processing (`imgproc` module)** â€“ transformations, filtering, histograms.
4. **Application Utils (`highgui`, `imgcodecs`, `videoio`)** â€“ display, I/O.
5. **Camera Calibration & 3D Reconstruction (`calib3d`)** â€“ intrinsic/extrinsic parameters, stereo vision.
6. **Object Detection (`objdetect`)** â€“ Haar cascades, face detection.
7. **2D Features Framework (`feature2d`)** â€“ SIFT, ORB, feature matching.
8. **Deep Neural Networks (`dnn`)** â€“ loading and running pre-trained models.
9. **Graph API (`gapi`)** â€“ pipeline-based execution.
10. **Other Modules** â€“ `ml`, `photo`, `stitching`, `video`.
11. **Theory of Image Processing** â€“ pixels, convolution, edge detection, Fourier transforms.
